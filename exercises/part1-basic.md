# EXERCISE ONE

Open the tool you’re going to be using.

Ask your AI to help you build the following tool: 

- Take a markdown file as input – see markdown folder in repo for a sample (sample-input.md)
- The markdown file is text from a Slack channel.
- There are also 28 sample reply threads, in sub-folder in markdown folder
- You want the tool to identify reply thread insertion points, and insert each reply thread in the correct place
- You want a nice UI that allows users to upload either all the relevant markdown files, or paste text in directly
- (WARNING: If you paste text directly from Slack, it will not format nicely. The sample markdown files have already had some processing.)
- The output should be a nicely formatted markdown file.
- DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WRITE CODE YOURSELF. NO TESTS UNLESS THE LLM SAYS SO! THE LLM IS IN CHARGE.
- If you finish this exercise and want more, see `exercises/part1-extensions.md`.
- Go!
