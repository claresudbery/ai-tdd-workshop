In a nutshell, this is why Python has always left a bad taste in my mouth. I appreciate how hard it is to do cross platform support well, and I appreciate the endless efforts that the python community makes to deal with it. But it’s still just a mess. 
That’s one of the things I really appreciate about Go.  I wrote something on Mac to run on windows, and I compiled it in one line and it ran the first time, with zero runtime dependencies. It just doesn’t get any better than that.

Yeah, I'm a big fan of the python devs from an intention (and overall results) standpoint, but this feels like a philosophical dead-end that they just won't let go of  (cf: packaging, async, virtual envs, etc, etc, etc)

Of course, I had bugs related to windows file handling, but they were my bugs, nothing to do with Go

Most of my python is scripts, dashboards, and web servers and they just work.
