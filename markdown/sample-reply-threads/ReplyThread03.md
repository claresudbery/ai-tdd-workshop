It’s not the code that’s interesting though (there wasn’t much of it), it’s the [process files](https://github.com/LearnWithLlew/AgenticAi.Java.StarterProject/tree/b5c08c13cb052c69f3e8d89c817e2e3638f07315/.windsurf/processes) - which were the point of the talk. (edited)

My notes are [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/clare-wiki-career/Clare's+Career/0+-+Missions/09-AI-Mission/AI+people/Llewellyn+Falco/Llewellyn+Falco#Contents+of+this+file). Not actually sure how useful they are to anyone except me - you’re probably better off just watching the video - but I’ve just added a ToC and some summaries that make them slightly more useful I think. (edited)

Efficient != Fast

Your notes were really interesting and useful.  I’ll be going through this in the near future for an experiment—thanks!

Great, I'm glad they were useful!

heh "efficient" -- I suppose you were very efficient in extracting the maximum value from the presentation. Someone who glossed over it at double-speed while playing video games would be faster, but would not have efficiently extracted value.

Sharing templates, prompts, and process files is the new community activity.

Yes!

I don’t equate speed with efficiency, but I do wonder whether 2.5 days on one video and writing obsessively detailed notes was the best use of my time, and whether the value I extract will be worth the effort expended.
What I have to remind myself is that there were a lot of side quests, a lot of related notes, and now not _only_ do I have a detailed understanding of exactly how Llewellyn gets value from process files and scripts, I have a bunch of other useful stuff too.

What tools are people here using? Llewellyn uses Windsurf with four different AI agents - GPT, Gemini, Claude and SWE - but in the demo he stuck with GPT, with a little Gemini at the end for his daily status report. (edited)

I use warp - a command shell with agentic abilities - and the Jetbrains tools. I have played with cursor IDE. I also played with two cloud idea. One was Repl.it and I can’t recall the other. I use perplexity for search, ChatGPT for convo, and consensus to surface academic papers I want to see.
