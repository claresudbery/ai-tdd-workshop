no, not autonomously, more like parallel typing while conversing.
Eg: after we have a valid, failing test, we decide that we want to use a dequeue to make it pass, so you start writing the code, while I look up the particulars for it in the language du jour. or perhaps, Im grabbing some appropriate lorem ipdum text we can use in thus next test, etc.

we'd also be switching roles frequently. on one of my teams, we had both the double monitor/keyboard workstations and individual laptops which meant switching roles didn't even require rearranging our physical space/seats. and since the workstations were team machines, we could (and did) frequently swap pairs.

but regardless of equipment, the key point is to divide labor, but not context (harder remotely but doable).

OK, “autonomous” was the wrong word. I get that the research is happening as a part of the pair’s activities rather than entirely separately, but my point is that the main machine of the pair would be coding with the LLM’s help, and a lot of the research would be happening via the LLM, rather than as a separate activity on a separate machine.

But you might still want to do independent research to check the AI’s conclusions and suggestions. (edited)

I’m not sure I agree that’s harder remotely? If you’re both/all on the same call then you all have the same context. Depending on how many screens you have there _might_ be a slight overhead in switching between your screen and someone else’s screen, but not much. (edited)
