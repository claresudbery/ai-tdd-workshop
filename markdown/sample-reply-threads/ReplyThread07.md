Hmmm. I may have been prematurely excited.

Ended up getting stuck in a Clare loop, which meant staying up til 4:45am with predictably diminishing returns.
7:06
Long story short: My initial message was me being waaay over-excited by the fact that it built an app that ran. Then followed an endless bug-fixing loop.
7:06
Mea very culpa.

The main problem was that I didn’t think of it as a coding project so much as an “I’m in a hurry and I want to automate this tedious task.”
7:08
Anyway, the good news is that it’s given me loads of fodder for thinking and writing about this stuff. And when I next have time (won’t be before next week) I can revisit it, do it properly, and probably get much better results.

I was way too tired and impatient to even look at the code it generated, so it’s definitely horrible. Instead I focused on the process file. Very late (4am or so) I asked it to write some tests, but I had no brain left to even look at them. Pretty sure they were horrible too. Based on what it was _saying_ about them, I think they were probably horrendous.
7:10
Anyway I have lots of ideas about what to do next.

The way I see it is like this: What I was after was a quick and dirty tool that would help me do an annoying, fiddly and typically time consuming job.
I failed at that, because I only have half a tool (it is actually half useful, and I did use it successfully today to halve the work on a different thread), and the amount of time I spent building is more than I would have spent just doing the annoying fiddly job.
BUT. What I did get (and wasn't originally aiming for) is a really good example of both how not to do this stuff, and crucially _why_ it doesn't work if you do it this way.

And potentially even a straight example I can throw students at, so they get the experience of a shitshow, before I guide them to a better experience with better practices. (edited)
