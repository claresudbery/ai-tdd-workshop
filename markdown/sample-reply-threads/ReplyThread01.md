Hi  
**We are at Bimble Cottage, Bimbletown, Bimbleshire LMXX XXX**
AA, 12:40:  
Thanks for choosing to contact us on WhatsApp.  
Unfortunately, we’ve hit a bit of a speed bump and some of our teams are currently unavailable. So it may take longer than usual for us to get back to you, but one of our team will reply as soon as they’re free. We’ll pick up messages sent outside our opening hours on the next working day.  
If you’re happy to wait, tell me what you need help with today and I’ll get you moving in the right direction. Or feel free to come back another time.

I didn’t quite catch that - your message may be too long for me to understand.  
Try sending a short sentence under 10 words to summarise the help you need. Or type ‘menu’ for a list of topics to get you started.
