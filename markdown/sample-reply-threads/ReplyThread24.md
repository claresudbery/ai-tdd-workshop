've Been Blocked By Two Prominent AI Influencers For Asking Two Simple Questions
11. Who paid you to do that research?
12. Why don't you disclose it?
Seems only fair given they are promoting what is supposed to appear like genuine, honest, and objective information.
And it's easy to fall for it because it seems to real.
But not surprisingly, the data they release, always supports the industry's narrative that GenAI is boosting productivity and helping to eliminate workers.
Yet all the authentic and unbiased data tells a very different story.
And when you ask them, rather than simply answering the question, which seems easy enough, they get upset
As someone who teaches research methodology at UC Berkeley, I teach my students that the first question you ask about any study is: who paid for it. And the second question: Who benefits from it.
Because funding shapes research design, interpretation, and how results get publicized.
We've seen this playbook before.
Sugar invented it in the 50s
Tobacco refined it in the 90s
Big Pharma ran with it until they got stopped by regulation
And now, GenAI has perfected it (and there is no regulation)
The pattern:
Industry under existential threat (hundreds of billions at risk)
buys credibility through prestigious institutions
funds the research to show favorable results
amplifies it through biased "trusted" voices
Hides the funding source(s)
What Does the Real Research Tell Us
Enterprise AI adoption is declining⁵...(not slowing, reversing)
95% of GenAI pilots are failing⁶...
OpenAI loses $5 billion annually⁷...($83 million a day)
Industry unit economics are upside down
US Census shows enterprise GenAI adoption in full retreat
No credible ROI
No net job losses (GenAI is too unreliable to replace a monkey)
Only 2-3% of people actually convert
Industries under threat don't just accept reality.
They do what threatened industries have always done:
buy institutional credibility
and amplify narratives that keep the money flowing.
So, remember, just because you read it on the Internet, doesn't make it true

BREAKING- Amazon Just Announced 30,000 Layoffs, The Largest In Its History
Want to know why? The real reason, not the reason they're saying
Their CEO blamed “AI transformation.”
But here’s what he didn’t tell you:
Amazon is spending $100 billion on AI infrastructure running at just 12–18% utilization.
That means 85% sits idle while 30,000 people lose their jobs to pay for it.
Read that again, slowly: 85% of all their AI capacity sits idle, while they spend billions to build more. This is insane
They're panic-investing in more infrastructure when they are barely using the capacity they have and may never need.
And this is the pattern across Big Tech, because it appears they are all doing it because t… Show more

BREAKING- Amazon Just Announced 30,000 Layoffs, The Largest In Its History
Want to know why? The real reason, not the reason they're saying
Their CEO blamed “AI transformation.”
But here’s what he didn’t tell you:

That means 85% sits idle while 30,000 people lose their jobs to pay for it.
Read that again, slowly: 85% of all their AI capacity sits idle, while they spend billions to build more. This is insane
They're panic-investing in more infrastructure when they are barely using the capacity they have and may never need.
And this is the pattern across Big Tech, because it appears they are all doing it because they are all doing it:
Amazon: 9% revenue growth to 30K layoffs
Microsoft: 15% growth to $80B AI spend to 9K layoffs
Google: 12% growthto $85B spend to hundreds laid off
Meta: 16% growth to $69B spend to 600 layoffs
Total: $364B in AI infrastructure. 100K+ jobs gone.[4]
What’s really happening
1. Building more while most sits empty
Fortune reports 10 million servers idle - $30 billion wasted.
They’re building new data centers while firing workers to afford them.
2. Hardware becomes obsolete before deployment
Amazon cut server depreciation from 6 to 5 years because equipment loses value before it’s even used
3. Cash flow turning negative
Morgan Stanley: AI leaders’ free cash flow down 16%.
4. Wall Street is uneasy
75% of S&P gains come from AI firms.
Morgan Stanley warns of a “Cisco moment”, when optimism outpaced returns in 2000.
Goldman CEO: “A lot of this capital won’t deliver returns.”
Translation
“AI transformation” = We’re firing people to fund servers.
“Efficiency gains” = 12% utilization and mounting debt.
Big tech isn't cutting jobs because AI works.
They’re cutting jobs because it doesn't.
The real cost
$364B could fund healthcare or infrastructure, instead it’s buying idle compute.
Data centers now consume 7–12% of national electricity while running mostly empty.
When the spending wave ends, billions in stranded assets will remain.
This isn’t transformation.
It’s misallocation, financial, human, and environmental.
When Amazon fires 30,000 people while 85% of its data centers sit idle,
that’s not innovation. It's mismanagement
