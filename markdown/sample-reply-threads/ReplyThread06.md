It: “You’re right that I didn’t follow the instructions correctly in several instances. Looking at the process file, I can see several areas where it could be improved to make it clearer and easier to follow:
UpdateEbombList.process.md
+33
-11
I’ve updated the process file to make it much clearer and easier to follow. Here are the key improvements I made:
Major Changes Made:
1. Added Sequential Structure: Added “FIRST:“, “THEN:“, “FINALLY:” to step 1 to make the order explicit
2. Added Stop Points: Added “STOP HERE” warnings after steps 1 and 2 to prevent rushing ahead
3. Made Step Boundaries Clear: Added a critical warning at the top: “Complete each step fully before moving to the next step”
4. Clarified Step 2: Made it crystal clear this is ONLY about adding emojis to existing headings, not fixing links or adding new topics
5. Enhanced Step 3: Added specific examples and clarified this is about fixing links broken by step 2
6. Improved Step 5: Made it explicit this is about table of contents in the SOURCE FILE, with a concrete example
7. Added DO/DON’T Lists: Clear guidance on what to do and what not to do in step 2
Why These Changes Help:
- Sequential clarity: The FIRST/THEN/FINALLY structure prevents skipping steps
- Scope boundaries: Each step now clearly states what it does and doesn’t include
- Concrete examples: Added specific examples showing the before/after format
- Stop points: Explicit instructions to complete each step before moving on
- Emphasis on critical points: Used bold formatting for the most important warnings
These changes should prevent the issues we encountered where steps were combined or the wrong files were modified. The process now has clear guardrails and examples for each step.” (edited)

It’ll be interesting to see whether its suggested changes are effective. (edited)

i'm starting to understand a bit better why this happens (it's the sliding context window thing) and thus why Claude is supplementing with satellite apps: as a chat tool chatgpt et al, don't have that capability, but because it's a "conversation" it's extremely counterintuitive because it's trained to act like that which creates a stronger illusion than otherwise.

“trained to act like that” - trained to act like what specifically?

The new process file works like a dream btw

think I’ve finally got this one nailed. maybe.

This was an experiment to learn and demonstrate a bunch of stuff… but as has always been the case when trying to automate stuff… the amount of time I’ve spent on getting a fit-for-purpose process file is way longer than if I’d just done the original task manually and not bothered with getting AI involved. That xkcd cartoon springs to mind.
It’s definitely quicker to do the process now that I have the process file working. But will I need to repeat this particular process enough times to recoup the investment? Debatable.

I _did_ have fun though. 
10.5 hours at my desk today. Flew by.

Time to step. away. from. the. computer.

apologies, I got pulled away suddenly, and then never made it back to my desk

glad you got it working!

This is something I've been wondering about, so I'm veh interested.
I like the fawning tone, because I have a deeply ingrained fear of being annoying, or too demanding, or running up against the limits of what others can bear from me. I find myself being reluctant to ask too much from the AI, so it's reassuring to me when it keeps being so damn cheerful and apologetic.
5:22
But in the middle of yesterday's session, when it was making repeated mistakes that I had to keep pointing out, it stopped apologising or doing the whole "oh yes! You're right! I got that wrong!" thing and just kept saying "ok I'll do xxx" without acknowledging that it had made a mistake. I found that intriguing. I don't know why it changed.
5:23
I keep meaning to ask it to talk to me as though it was Rosa Luxemberg or Ada Lovelace or whatever, but I keep forgetting.

I **think** that's somewhat dependent on the rest of the chat? I find thatvas I try to dial in the bot like this, that it csn get terse and even surly (one of the many cues that result in me starting a new session and pasting in my "base instructions"— no idea why it happens and my guess is that it's extremely difficult to know (ie its in the nature of these tools to be unable to trace their specific inferences down)? but just guessing

Interesting. I start new chats every few prompts. Apart from anything else, it's a good way of giving my process files a workout.

I tend to hold on to sessions as long as they seem to be working (some for months!) but I'm not testing a process!

The advice is not to do that because of context windows. Hang on...

yup, but when they reach a certain balance (with regard to my base instructions) I get good results for a long time (and it's easier to remind it) eventually it degrades on both counts and I start a new one (I also mean months of existence, not months of daily use)

Cool ok
